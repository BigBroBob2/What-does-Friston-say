# Free-energy principle: mathematical review

Note for [Buckley et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022249617300962?via%3Dihub)

## Introduction

Free-energy principle (FEP)
- Aim
  - 'unified brain theory'
  - adaptive biological processes beyond brain 
- History
  - Helmholtzâ€™ proposal: perceptions from sensory data
  - 'Bayesian brain' and 'predictive coding'
  - Hinton: 'Helmholtz machines'
- basis for integrating
  - Bayesian brain
  - neural Darwinism
  - Hebbian cell assemly 
  - optimal control
  - game theory

Generalization
- all viable biological organisms resist tendency to disorder (homoeostatic, autopoietic), and must therefore minimize atypical event occurence ('surprisal') in their habitable environments (envs) (changing sensory input via action on world; update internal model via perception)

Free-energy (from information theory)
- an upper bound on 'surprising events'
- can be evaluated by organisms
